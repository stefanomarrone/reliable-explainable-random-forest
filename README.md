# Reliable and Explainable Random Forests
 
A reliable and explainable framework for Random Forest

## Motivation
The software here contained is related to a scientific research providing a modelling and analysis framework for the boosting Random Forests for reliability and explainability. The framework is based on the formalism of Bayesian Networks.
